# KeyboardListener
This is a javascript program run through the command prompt utilizing node js to detect a key press and log it to the command prompt with the ability to save it to a text file as well.

Run with 'node Keypress.js \[-save\]'

Running using the '-save' option allows for the keyboard output to be written to an output txt file, 'Keypress_Output.txt'.

This project was created to log key presses from devices to see which keys are being pressed.  The issue at hand was a foreign keyboard with unknown key binds.  So without just typing with it, a key logging program was created.
